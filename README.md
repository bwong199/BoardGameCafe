# BoardGameCafe

This is a draft website I am building for a boardgame-themed cafe that will open in Calgary in 2016. The front-end work was done using jQuery, Bootstrap, and jQuery UI. 

The owners of the cafe wanted a one-page site, but wanted to list all the board games. I used tabs and accordtion to keep the contents clean, yet be able list them.
